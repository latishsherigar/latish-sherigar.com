You know how and why a particular thing works and that&#8217;s what every programmer wants , coz programmers are inquistive by nature.<\/p>\n<p>The best thing i like about is everything is file based. What this means is that almost everything on the OS is configurable by changing the right settings. If u know what exactly u are doing u can write u r own shell script for small tasks or write a full fledged program in u r favorite language to perform the function u need instead of  depending on some external tools   which will some other bells and whistles attached to it.<\/p>\n<p>I have been a Visual basic programmer myself and i must say that i enjoy programming in Linux much greater than in Windows.<\/p>\n<p>Its not necessary for u to be C or a C++ programmer to program under Linux. C or C++ is best suited for system level programming. There are lot of applications which can be written in a language such as Java. Many also prefer Python which is also a popular OO language.<\/p>\n<p>So don&#8217;t worry, be Happy&#8230;.Start Programming under Linux.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Linux is known to be as a programmer&#8217;s OS i.e that the OS had been built by programmers for programmers.

In case you are interested in details of that build <a href=\"\/blogs\/linux\/building-remote-for-my-media-center-pc\/\">here is the post<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used this setup for some time but later came to the conclusion that the desktop form factor  does not fit well in a living room media player setup. At this point I decided to give Raspberry pi a try. I had an Model B+ lying around which was just used by me once in a while for my experiments. I had the impression that it would crash or in worst case burnout with the &#8220;heavy&#8221; media files i was going to throw at it. I still went ahead withe the following setup<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Media &#8211;  A USB portable  hard disk which had my media files.<\/li><li>USB remote &#8211; The one i mentioned above<\/li><li>Display &#8211; HDMI output connected to TV.<\/li><li>Audio &#8211; USB to Optical \/ TOSLINK audio sound card which is then connected to my AV receiver.<\/li><li>Internet (Optional) &#8211; A USB WIFI adapter which can be used for installing additional software or getting updates.<\/li><li>Operating System &#8211; OSMC &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/osmc.tv\/\">https:\/\/osmc.tv<\/a><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I was blown away by the performance of the setup. It was performing exactly like my desktop computer without any slowness.The audio and video play back was super smooth. I was also able to get Dolby Digital output from the sound card without any effort. OSMC is a beauty and works like a charm. Full marks to its developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am extremely happy with the current setup and also proud of myself (especially the remote \ud83d\ude42 for getting this setup working.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was a big believer of HTPC (Home Theater Personal computer) and therefore upgraded my desktop some time back so that it could be connected to my Yamaha AV receiver.

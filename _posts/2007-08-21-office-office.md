I keep on hearing many success stories of Windows to Linux migration . I feel some major credit should go to

OpenOffice

for making these migrations successful (atleast for non-technical users)  .

Any Office package mainly consists of a Word processor, a Spreadsheet software and  most probably a Presentation software.  There are many packages available in Linux which  can be called as an Office package. I personally feel OpenOffice is the best one can get in the Linux world, although there are many who hate OpenOffice for being bloated and terribly slow. I wouldn’t oppose this argument coz these are true to a certain extent but its advantages outweigh its disadvantages.

The official site is at

At last what matters is personal taste…and the best of the lot can only be found by experimenting.

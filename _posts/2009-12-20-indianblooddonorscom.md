I regularly receive queries from my friends for a requirement of a particular blood group. Was thinking it would be kool if we had some database so that people could query for their blood requirement and they get to know someone with a exact match. Some googling and i found this really good site i.e

indianblooddonors.com

which serves the exact purpose.

To explain in plain English ,2 things can be done here

1. Donors can register for donating blood.

2.  Request for blood can be made by anybody who requires it.

Rediff also has a article about the founder

here

.

Go ahead and check this site out. The least one can do is continue to spread the word about this  so that it could make a difference to someone’s life.

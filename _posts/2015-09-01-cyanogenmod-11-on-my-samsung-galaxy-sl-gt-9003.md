Flashed CyanogenMod 11 (based on Kitkat) on a old Samsung Galaxy SL GT-9003 which I managed to get my hands on. I wish the phone had little more CPU power and RAM to run Kitkat in its full beauty but it is way better than getting stuck on Gingerbread which was the last official update from Samsung.

Thanks to a developer on xda-developers.com for creating a build for my phone.

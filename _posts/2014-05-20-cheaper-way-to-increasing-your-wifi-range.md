If you need to increase the range of your WiFi router (assuming you have placed it correctly) , you can either buy a dedicated wireless repeater which are also quite expensive OR you can upgrade your old router to work as a Repeater (assuming you have 1 more spare router available)  by using the famous third party firmware DD-

WRT

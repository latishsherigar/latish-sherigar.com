2 P’s …which play a very important role in deciding the job you are in.

Paisa- The one ‘P’ you cannot do without ( except when you dad has lots of that)

Passion – The other ‘P’ (which is technically not required) when present  can make life a lot easier.

What do you work for ? Is it possible to combine the 2 P’s and live a happy life. ? What do you feel is the ideal percentage of both to make life a “Star bucks”  ? 🙂

This is a “food for thought”  post with me expecting all the answers so that poor souls like me can be enlightened.

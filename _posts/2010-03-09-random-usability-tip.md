Got this error in Internet explorer where in i had typed “http” for a “https” URL. A simple example of a poor user interface.  Although the interface does a great job of analyzing the actual issue it does a poor job of helping users resolve this.

A link to the https site or a automatic redirection to the actual https site would have helped a lot instead of a full page of techie stuff.

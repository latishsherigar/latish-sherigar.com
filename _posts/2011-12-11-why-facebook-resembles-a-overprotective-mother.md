When i am quite for a few days, she gets worried and starts pestering my friends to send me a message.

She force feeds me all types of information i would never need from my friends..like the one who thinks he is doing the world a favor by liking or sharing ever single article on the internet about United States invasion of Iraq.

When i want to leave, she still gives me 14 days to rethink my decision and says that she will be waiting for me all the time to come back home.

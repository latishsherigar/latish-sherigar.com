GiveIndia.org

is a platform acting as an Umbrella organisation for other charity NGO’s ensuring that the majority of the funds which you donate reach and are used correctly.

Their website states “We do not raise funds for ourselves.  We help you donate to these NGOs.

We tell you exactly where your money went and also give you proof of it through the feedback report. We ensure that at least 90% of your contribution reaches the organization you support (as against the average of 60% for the NGO sector). ”

Check out their

website

They also let users create their own Pledge pages called

iGive

pages where in you can pledge a certain amount to your favorite charity and ask your family, friends,relatives and anybody you know to donate for your pledge . Best suited for ‘no gifts’ marriages and other occasions.

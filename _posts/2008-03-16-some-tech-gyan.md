I usually don’t put in technical info here but since right now i don’t have a dedicated place for that, i thought i would put in here.

Anybody interested intrested in software should check both these sites.

http://www.ericsink.com

http://www.joelonsoftware.com

These are guys who know a lot about software and software business. Of course there are many but to start these 2 places are a good start.

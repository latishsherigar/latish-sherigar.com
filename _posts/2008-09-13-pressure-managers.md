Most of us have already worked or are working under a managerial species called the  “Pressure Managers”. These type of managers believe that every output can be derived by applying pressure. They follow the simple theory …More output ..More pressure ..Tight Deadlines..Even more pressure. This “quality” is seen in higher management guys who generally work only with word processors,Spreadsheets and mail programs. From that point every problem in this world seems easily solvable by just altering few numbers on the spreadsheet. Here is a simple picture what a pressure manager might look in some other circumstances.

A line of disclaimer:

The above qualities are not necessarily possessed by every manager 🙂 so if you are my manager reading this there is no need to get disappointed.

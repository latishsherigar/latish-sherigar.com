I recently helped 2 people fix the “User profile could not be loaded error” in Windows 7. Posting this here after realizing this that it may be a common problem and you need not necessarily go to a technician to fix this.  The solution to this issue is present in this Microsoft support page.Be warned that this involves changing registry settings.

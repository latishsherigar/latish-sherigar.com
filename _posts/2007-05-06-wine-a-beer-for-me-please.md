Sorry to disappoint a lot of my friends but WINE in this case is simply another piece of software present in Linux.

The official definition states the following “Wine Is Not a           (CPU) Emulator.”

Wine just provides the windows

API

for u r windows software to run under Linux , It comes as a blessing when u r stuck with the Windows only version of u r favorite software in Linux.

Head on to WINE home at

http://www.winehq.org/

for all the info u would ever need about it.

Although its a good attempt but i must say that its still not perfect . Since it tries to emulate Windows

API

, where there are many undocumented features there are times when not all u r favorite software may run under it as it may be using those undocumented features.

During such times its best to pray that there exists a similar or better version or clone of the software u are suck with. A little bit of Googling helps in almost all such cases though.

Many recent distributions come with the latest stable version of WINE and are also configured to execute Windows

executable’s

with WINE.

So just click and see u r Windows

program’s

come alive in Linux with some WINE 🙂 .

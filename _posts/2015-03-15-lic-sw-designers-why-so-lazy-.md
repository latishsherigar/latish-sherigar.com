The following screenshot is from one of of top Insurance provider’s website payment transaction status page.

The highlighted part in the circle shows the transaction status page. Strangely the software designers decided that showing some internal number was a better decision than following the norm i.e. showing a proper status description. A table down the screen shows all possible descriptions against all the codes in the system. It does not require a software architect to figure that this is a blunder from usability point of view.

It is due to such instances that layman users find technology hard to use.

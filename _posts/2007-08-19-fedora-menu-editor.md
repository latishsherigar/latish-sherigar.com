I have been using Gnome 2.14 with Fedora core 5 for some time but recently felt the need to  edit menus. At that point I realized that  a simple menu editor was missing  for Gnome. I tired to look in the menus but could find nothing. At last i googled for the info and found some piece of info which made me laugh at myself. The editor was sitting right in front of me but i couldn’t notice it. Actually it was not fully my fault . The editor is only accessible if u ‘Right Click’ on the Feodra Logo sitting usually on the top left corner of u r screen (unless u have changed it) .  The logo can be seen in the following image.

The Menu editor looks as follows

This is a basic Menu editor but is sufficient for the job most of the times.

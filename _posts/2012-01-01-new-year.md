The calendar has changed to a new year.Nothing much changes.The new year will not suddenly solve the old problems or change the way how things are done.

The issues would still exist in this new year. Some will cause damage. Others might not but they would still need attention.

There would have many other things for which I did not give enough attention in the year that passed but i now realise that I should have.

I hope i make this new year actually “new” by changing things for better,if i can. I hope i will at least try to sort out many of the things which have been messed up and which i have putting in the back burner the full last year.

I hope i will be successful in many of the things i tried last year but failed.

Its time for the “New year” 😉

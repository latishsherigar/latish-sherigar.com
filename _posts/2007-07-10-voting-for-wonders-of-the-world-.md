Personally i never liked the idea of selecting the wonders of the world by popular votes. The whole process never made any sense to me.what i feel a better way would have been  was to form a panel of experts and let them decide  since they have little more knowledge than the guy at the bus stop frantically SMSing his favorite wonder .

This whole thing could be a BIG scam by international telecom companies to increase their revenue….this may not be the truth…but who knows.

But as they say “All’s well that ends well”…..TAJ MAHAL  has been selected as one of the new 7 wonders and I being an Indian feel really proud about it.

Wah Taj!

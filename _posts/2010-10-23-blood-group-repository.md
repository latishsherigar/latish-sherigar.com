Am trying out a small experiment of maintaining a common blood group repository. Anybody interested can checkout this link.

https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?hl=en&authkey=CKPg9oEB&formkey=dGtfNkhnZHVfTmFjTTZ0MFB5UXA3VlE6MQ#gid=0

The form saves the data in a google spreadsheet.  This could be helpful in times of emergency.

Please let me know any suggestions on  this.

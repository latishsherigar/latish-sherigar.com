Relativity. "Built" (vibe coded) this application with Google Antigravity. This app can be used to manage your own family tree. Allows you to add family members including extended family, add relations and view them in a nice tree format ( looks good in a large screen).

Reason for creating this app was I feel documenting the relationship is important especially from our next generation point of view. 

1. Requires only a Gmail login
2. Each family is private and is viewable only to anyone who is related.

Linux systems have a built in ability to mount ISO files which then can be used as normal cd or dvds . The command to do this is

mount – o loop  /path/to/isofile.iso  /mount/foldername

Things like this make me love Linux more as performing a similar trick in Windows would have required a third party software to be installed which would mean more work for a lazy guy like me 😉 .

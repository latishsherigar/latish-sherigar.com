Some time ago i had a post on

Paisa,Passion

which was a result of my trying to set the priorities for both. During the

discussion/debate/introspection few questions came up. An interesting point that came up during this whole process was about handling the feeling of guilt which came in when you saw others in need even for basic resources.

The following  questions makes an attempt to trigger the thought process for those who have still not thought about it.

How much money do you want to make.

Why do you want to make this much amount of money

How will be others in need benefited by your wealth.

There is no right or wrong answer here. These would be the answers you may have to give to your kids someday 🙂 .

Your thoughts on this are welcome.

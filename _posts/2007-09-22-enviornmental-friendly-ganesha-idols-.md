One of my friends mailed me some pics  showing the morning after ‘Ganesh Visrajan’ at some beach….Looking at the pics it feels like we really need to change our tradition of immersing mega size idols or we need to work something out immediately for creating environmental friendly idols.

If one is least concerned about the environment alteast he needs to fear the god whom he prays a day before and leaves his statue in such a state the next day.

Forgive us Ganesha

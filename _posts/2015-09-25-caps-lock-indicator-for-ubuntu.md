I have a Logitech wireless keyboard K400r which I feel is a really good product except for one thing – No indicator lights for dual mode keys like Caps lock / Num lock etc.

Its a pain every time you need to enter passwords. I had to check the status by typing some dummy text in a text editor before actually typing the passwords. After some time of bearing the pain, one fine day I tried to search if there was some kind of application which displays the current status of these buttons on the screen. To my pleasant surprise, there was already a Ubuntu app available called the

indicator-keylock

. Found the app in the Ubuntu software center and did a 1 click install.

Life is little easy now 🙂 .

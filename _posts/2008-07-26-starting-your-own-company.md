I have been reading

Eric Sink’s weblog

for some time and i must say he is one of those guys who know what they are talking about. The ‘been there..done it’ ones. He has an excellent post about how to start your own company . The post with not too much business jargon is so well written that even an dumbo would easily understand it . The post is available at

.

This would surely benefit many people like myself and many of my friends who keep on thinking about this topic but later lose interest due to insufficient pointers in the right direction.

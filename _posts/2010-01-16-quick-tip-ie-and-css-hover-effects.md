If you are stuck trying to producer mouse hover effects in IE (which seem to display perfectly in Firefox) , here is the solution

http://www.bernzilla.com/item.php?id=762

Add the following in the very start of the html web page:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">

This should solve the problem.

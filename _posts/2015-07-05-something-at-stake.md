Got some practical entrepreneurship Gyan yesterday from a friend over lunch time discussion.

You can never achieve your goals as an entrepreneur till you have something at stake.

It could be money, house or your self respect. Prior to this discussion i was working on a “zero budget” or “low budget” idea. I am a changed man now 🙂

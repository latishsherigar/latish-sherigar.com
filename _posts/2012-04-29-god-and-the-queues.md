Some very famous temples in India differentiate between rich and the poor through the system of different queues for different class of people. There could be a queue for those people who are ready to pay Rs 50 to meet the lord. There would be another queue of Rs 200 for some who think the price is worth it. The queue with  the highest price means that you get to go in the fastest. Fortunately there is a still a queue existing in such places which has no price tag attached to it but as they say there is no free lunch this queue means you get to spend a lot of time (sometimes even a whole day) with your “queue-mates”.

A part of me feels this practice is wrong as money should not come anywhere between you and God. The other part of me finds this human behaviour really funny. We manage to manipulate almost everything…even Mr God.

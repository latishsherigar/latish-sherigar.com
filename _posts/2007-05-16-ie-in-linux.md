In my previous post I had written about IE specific websites. Though u may have started using Linux and are really loving u r Firefox browser there are many more who use Windows and Internet Explorer on their systems and such users are the dominant force. Many web developers therefore create IE specific websites and don’t care about the rest non IE users.

This doesn’t mean that u have to throw away u r Linux and go for Windows where IE is available.

ies4linux

comes to the rescue. It uses WINE and runs IE on top of it. The application comes with a script which does all the job right from downloading the required dlls to installation . No extra configuration needed.

Till the time IE specific websites are created software such as

ies4linux

would be saving non Windows users from considerable pain.

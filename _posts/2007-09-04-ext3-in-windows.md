Recently I had a experience where in i had to reverse the migration of Linux to Windows. Although I was not really happy doing it , the job needed to be done. I needed information which was present in the Linux system and needed to be copied to the Windows system. The  difficult part used to be that moment when i used to  realize that the info needed by me was present in the ext3 file system which needed a reboot in to the Linux System.

But as they “Necessity is the mother of Invention”..I googled for something  which would allow me to  read the ext3 file system in Windows and within minutes i was using a tool called

LinuxReader

by DiskInternals. The program has a Windows Explorer like interface and does its job pretty well. I was able to access all my files and could save into the Windows file system.

A good tool for those dual booting between Windows and Linux and looking to share information between the 2 systems.

The only disadvantage is that this tool can only read ext2/ext3 file systems and will be of no use if u r file system is different.

As a part of my DIY hobby projects I had recently created a indoor water fountain out of the things which were lying around the house unused.  This project used the following -:

A submersible pump (18 w) which is used in air coolers, fountains. I did not select this for the rating but because it was available on a good discount on Amazon.

A clay pot which was at home.

My daughters water bottle.

Base of the plant pot

Working:

The pump is connected to the base of the water bottle and pushes water upwards. The cap of the water bottle has holes drilled which allows the water to come out.  Also added few money plants to give it a natural look. Below are few pics and a video.

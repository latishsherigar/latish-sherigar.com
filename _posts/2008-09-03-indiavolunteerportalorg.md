indiavolunteerportal.org

is an initiative mainly supported by Mastek Foundation. Here you get an opportunity for both type of volunteering, financial as well as non financial where in you donate your time and support the required activities which is listed out by every NGO. This is ideal for many of us who wanted to put some “actual” effort instead of just writing a cheque out although there are many who would prefer that option and leave the rest to such type of foundations/organizations who do the execution part. Whatever may be your choice you can check it out at

and help in bringing happiness to somebody in the world who deserves it .

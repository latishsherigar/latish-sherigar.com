Not clear how the brand/advertising department in Microsoft allowed Windows RT to be marketed as a separate brand. I know engineers must have put real hard work for this happen ( i have no idea in what goes in porting OS’s to different CPU architectures) but that does not mean the end consumer has any interest of the CPU architecture his device is running on. If you don’t agree you should probably go to your local computer shop and observe the customers and their questions. When such customers buy a tablet or phone or a music player they are more interested in the usability factor and the price of the device. They want good battery life. If you can provide the same battery life with a x86 based CPU i am all for you.

The problem is not that WindowsRT is a new product and still has the name Windows attached to it. The real problem is WindowsRT actually behaves differently than the regular Windows8. Customers who go in for a Microsoft Surface RT which launched recently thinking that they would be able to use it as a replacement of their Windows laptop would be disappointed/shocked/surprised as WindowsRT  is indeed a different creature which i feel should have been managed internally without the poor end user having to decide all the math.

I guess somebody out there at Microsoft forgot the

KISS

principle.

Many newbies in the Linux world hear regularly about LAMP.

LAMP

is a acronym used for the combination of

LINUX

,

APACHE,

Mysql

and

PHP

. This combination is used to develop and power web based solutions. All of the components are free and open source. LAMP is quite popular the reason being that all the components are really good in doing their job.

Also the ‘AMP’ in LAMP ensures portability since your solution would not depend upon the operating system. So the development of such a solution might happen in Linux but the deployment of the solution may be on a Windows server. The migration to any other OS would be trouble free as your solution would only depend upon Apache,Mysql and PHP.

Though ‘AMP’ ensures portablity its recommended to use the ‘full’ LAMP for your solutions as the software stack has undergone rigorous testing by thousands of people who have successfully deployed it in production web sites.

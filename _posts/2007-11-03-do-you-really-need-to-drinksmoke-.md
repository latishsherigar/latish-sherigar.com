Does, Not smoking and drinking alcohol make anybody immature or a child. ??  Well some of my “mature” friends do think so. Sure they get Cancers and many diseases as a gift along with their so called matureness .

Some research does suggest that moderate drinking may be actually good for health but i have seen people with their own version of “moderate” :)…..so this is matter of debate.

Here’s a health report from BBC’s website

Another one from About.com.

Looking at these reports one can say that it is not REALLY necessary to either drink or smoke and you can exist pretty well and also blog about other’s habits of drinking and smoking 😉 .

description: how to run the Jekyll site locally
---

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run this command to install the required Ruby gems:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

2. **Start the Jekyll Server**:
   Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

3. **View the Site**:
   Once the server starts, you can view the site in your browser at:
   `http://localhost:4000`

If you want the server to automatically reload when you make changes (which is the default), just keep the terminal running.
